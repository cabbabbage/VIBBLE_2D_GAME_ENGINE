Game Code To-Do List
====================

SceneRenderer.cpp
-----------------
- Vertical Squash Rendering
  Implement vertical squash scaling so that textures lower on the screen appear more
  vertically compressed than those higher up.
  - Taller assets should be squashed more to maintain perspective.

AssetsManager (and related classes)
-----------------------------------
- Suspend Movement in Dev Mode
  Add support for suspending all asset and player movement when Dev Mode is enabled.

DevMouseControls
----------------
- Camera Zoom with Scroll Wheel
  - Use mouse scroll wheel to control camera zoom.
  - Introduce a zoom_scale_factor (better name than "zoom percent multiplier").
  - Default value = 1.0.
  - Scrolling up → increase zoom; scrolling down → decrease zoom.
  - Final zoom = current_scale * zoom_scale_factor.

AssetInfoUI
-----------
- Editor Window Toggle
  Add a left-hand editor panel that can be toggled on/off when an open section requires it.

AnimationUpdate.cpp
-------------------
- Movement Override Mode
  Add support for a movement override mode that uses a vector of movement frames
  to control animations directly.

Camera.cpp
----------
- Zoom in on Asset
  Add a function to zoom in on and pan to a specific asset.
  - Behavior should respect the zoom_scale_factor.

Audio.cpp
---------
- Audio Engine Implementation
  Implement a basic audio engine to handle sound playback, management, and integration.

AnimationConfig.py
------------------
- Animation Audio Integration
  Add support for uploading and linking audio with animations.

FireSpreading Class
-------------------
- Flammable Asset Behavior
  Implement a fire-spreading system where flammable objects (defined by a "flammable" bool
  in asset_info) can catch fire. Fire spreads via fire assets, and eventually transforms
  or destroys affected objects.

custom_controllers/DefaultController.cpp
----------------------------------------
- Event Animation Handlers
  Add basic event-driven animation handlers such as:
  - Interact
  - Collide
  - Other common gameplay events

Trail Generation
----------------
- Multi-Path Connectivity
  Modify trail generation so rooms can connect to more than just children.
  Ideally every room should be accessible from the center via at least two distinct paths
  (except rooms on the furthest radius).

DevMode UI / AssetInfoUI
------------------------
- Python → C++ Migration
  Add the remaining sections of logic currently in Python to the C++ Dev Mode UI,
  ensuring they can be displayed inside AssetInfoUI.

DevMouseControls (Click + Drag)
-------------------------------
- Context-Sensitive Drag
  Adjust click-and-drag camera/asset logic so behavior differs based on spawn_id
  and spawn_type.

Room Save Logic
---------------
- Save Exact Positions
  Update save-room logic to match the new version (inverse of how exact positions
  are used when spawning).

Main Character Animation
------------------------
- Flickering Fix
  Fix issue where the main character’s animation occasionally flickers or fails
  to render smoothly.
