Game Code To-Do List
====================

SceneRenderer.cpp
-----------------
- Vertical Squash Rendering
  Implement vertical squash scaling so that textures lower on the screen appear more
  vertically compressed than those higher up.
  - Taller assets should be squashed more to maintain perspective.

AssetsManager (and related classes)
-----------------------------------
- Suspend Movement in Dev Mode
  Add support for suspending all asset and player movement when Dev Mode is enabled.

DevMouseControls
----------------
- Camera Zoom with Scroll Wheel
  - Use mouse scroll wheel to control camera zoom.
  - Introduce a zoom_scale_factor (better name than "zoom percent multiplier").
  - Default value = 1.0.
  - Scrolling up → increase zoom; scrolling down → decrease zoom.
  - Final zoom = current_scale * zoom_scale_factor.

AssetInfoUI
-----------
- Editor Window Toggle
  Add a left-hand editor panel that can be toggled on/off when an open section requires it.

AnimationUpdate.cpp
-------------------
- Movement Override Mode
  Add support for a movement override mode that uses a vector of movement frames
  to control animations directly.

Camera.cpp
----------
- Zoom in on Asset
  Add a function to zoom in on and pan to a specific asset.
  - Behavior should respect the zoom_scale_factor.
