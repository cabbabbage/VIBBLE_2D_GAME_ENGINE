Audio.cpp
---------
- Audio Engine Implementation
  Implement a basic audio engine to handle sound playback, management, and integration.

FireSpreading Class
-------------------
- Flammable Asset Behavior
  Implement a fire-spreading system where flammable objects (defined by a "flammable" bool
  in asset_info) can catch fire. Fire spreads via fire assets, and eventually transforms
  or destroys affected objects.

custom_controllers/DefaultController.cpp
----------------------------------------
- Event Animation Handlers
  Add basic event-driven animation handlers such as:
  - Interact
  - Collide
  - Other common gameplay events

Trail Generation
----------------
- Multi-Path Connectivity
  Modify trail generation so rooms can connect to more than just children.
  Ideally every room should be accessible from the center via at least two distinct paths
  (except rooms on the furthest radius).

DevMouseControls (Click + Drag)
-------------------------------
- Context-Sensitive Drag
  Adjust click-and-drag camera/asset logic so behavior differs based on spawn_id
  and spawn_type.

Room Save Logic
---------------
- Save Exact Positions
  Update save-room logic to match the new version (inverse of how exact positions
  are used when spawning).

Main Character Animation
------------------------
- Flickering Fix
  Fix issue where the main characterâ€™s animation occasionally flickers or fails
  to render smoothly.
