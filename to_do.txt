remaining issues: while mouse is fphysically over any floating collapsiable section or fullscreen collapsiable section, all mouse input should only effect that ui not the rest of the map of something else. if there are 2 on top of eachother that the one on top gets the input. if i click something on a floating collapisable, that click should not register for something that is behinf it. if i scroll a scrollable area in a collapsiable or full screen coolapiable i should not see the map zooming. change switching from map mode editor mode with teh zoom thing, instead have room config fullscreen collapiable heder have a button to switch to map mode and have map mode layers fullscreen collapiable have a button to switch to room editor. room config ful screen collpisable is not interactable, it also needs a button to open asset library. mak sure when im clicking things on a fullscreen collapsiable header the clicks do not register o things underneath. make the map assets thing prettier. have a button to open that in both map moe and room editor. come up with a plan to fix all these things all dealing with dev mode files. make sure room config has a check box to inherit map assets.
