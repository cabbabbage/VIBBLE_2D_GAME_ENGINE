# VIBBLE_2D_GAME_ENGINE
Vibble is a custom 2D game engine built in C++/SDL2 with procedural map generation, dynamic lighting, and asset-driven design. It loads maps and assets from JSON to spawn layered rooms, trails, and boundary assets, with a depth-sorted rendering pipeline, global lighting, parallax, and a Python editor for assets and maps.
